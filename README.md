# GPS-Clock
Using an ESP-32, TinyRTC, 7 segment display, and a GPS module: Make a clock that sets itself.

Note: This code is no-way the most efficient/graceful. This is a personal project.

# Inspiration
This project came out of the pure frustration I have/had with a night stand alarm clock bought from some un-named store.
The clock was strictly used for time keeping purposes, no alarm function. To my complete disbelief, the clock would drift +/- 5 minutes every month. With no explanation, that I know of.
Jokingly, the new meetup group, Null Space Labs, I was beginning to become a member of at the time, and am still to this day, said I should make my own.
And that's what I set out to do.

If you are interested in checking us them out, I highly recommend it.

# Discoveries

* Delay function does not play nice with this program, use millis() instead.

```
delay(1000);
```

* GPS encode inside the millis() section works great, it reads GPS data for frequently, and accurately.

```
unsigned long time_now = 0;
time_now = millis();
while(millis() < time_now + 1000){
	//wait approx.  1 second = (1000ms)
	char c = Serial2.read();
	gps.encode(c);
}
```

# Improvements

* Addition of tp4056 with an 18650 battery and switch.

* Custom make a PCB to mount everything in a smaller form factor.
