# GPS-Clock
Using an ESP-32, TinyRTC, 7 segment display, and a gps module: Make a clock that sets itself.

Note: This code is no-way the most efficient/graceful. This is a personal project.

# Inspiration
This project came out of the pure frustration I have/had with a night stand alarm clock bought from some un-named store.
The clock was strictly used for time keeping purposes, no alarm function. To my complete disbelief, the clock would drift +/- 5 minutes every month. With no explanation, that I know of.
Jokingly, the new meetup group, Null Space Labs, I was beginning to become a member of at the time, and am still to this day, said I should make my own.
And that's what I set out to do.

If you are interestd in checking us them out, I highly recommend it.
